### Bug Fixes

During the process of building the quiz I came accross a couple of bugs to be fixed.

The first bug I came across related to the functionality of the start page buttons. The play button to start the quiz was not functioning, and the instructions and how to play buttons would open the relevant divs but showing at the bottom of the page. I spoke with my Mentor, Luke, who pointed out the sections of my code causing the bug, making use of the Google Developer Tools. Using his guidance and further testing with Google Developer Tools, I sourced the issue to the javascript functions to hide the start page when each button is clicked.
